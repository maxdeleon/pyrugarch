# pyrugarch

## Introduction
Welcome to pyrugarch, a Python-based initiative inspired by the powerful rugarch package originally developed for R. Our goal is to bring the robustness of rugarch to the Python ecosystem, enabling users to leverage its capabilities in a Pythonic environment. If you're a fan of rugarch and Python, you're in the right place!

## Features
* GARCH Modeling: Implement various GARCH models, including the basic GARCH, EGARCH, and TGARCH specifications.
* Estimation and Forecasting: Utilize maximum likelihood estimation for model parameters and forecast future volatility with confidence intervals.
* Simulation and Inference: Generate synthetic time series data and conduct hypothesis testing on GARCH model parameters.
* Compatibility and Integration: Seamlessly integrate with other Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions of all forms! Whether you're looking to fix bugs, add new features, or improve the documentation, your help is invaluable to make pyrugarch even better. Here's how you can contribute:

* Submit a Pull Request (PR): Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a PR.
* Report Issues or Request Features: If you encounter any bugs or have ideas for new features, please file an issue.

## Acknowledgements

A special thank you to the original developers of the rugarch package for their pioneering work in GARCH modeling in R. This project stands on the shoulders of giants, and we aim to honor their contributions by extending the reach of their work into the Python community.
